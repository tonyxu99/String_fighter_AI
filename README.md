# String_fighter_AI

This project is folked from linyi's street-fighter-ai project. (https://github.com/linyiLYi/street-fighter-ai). Please refer the folked project's README for the environment setup.

My project has added the following features:

* Added a feature for human to [play aginst the AI](#play-aginst-ai).
* [Save state to a file](#save-state). 
* Allow human to press "START" button to join the fight (from 1 Player mode to 2 Player mode).
* Block AI to press "START" button as pressing "START" button will pause the game.
* Add [commmand line parameters](#commmand-line-parameters) to test.py and train.py
* [AI vs AI test](#ai-vs-ai-test)
* [Allow AI to play as player2](#player2_ai)
* AI vs AI training (comming soon)

## Play with the AI

### Setup
Find out the gym-retro game folder
```bash
python .\utils\print_game_lib_folder.py
```
Copy all files from the `data/` folder to gym-retro game folder. 

### <a name="play-aginst-ai"></a> Play aginst the AI
```bash
cd main
python play_with_ai.py
```

### Key Mapping
* Move - 'A', 'W', 'S', 'D'
* Arm - 'U', 'I', 'O'
* Leg - 'J', 'K', 'L'
* START (Join the fight / Pause) - 'N'
* Save state - 'B'

You can change the key mapping in keys_to_act() in interactive.py

### Trouble Shotting
You may see the following error 
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "play_with_ai.py", line 41, in <module>
    model = PPO.load(os.path.join(MODEL_DIR, MODEL_NAME), env=env)
  File "/home/tony/AI/String_fighter_AI/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/stable_baselines3/common/base_class.py", line 684, in load
    check_for_correct_spaces(env, data["observation_space"], data["action_space"])
  File "/home/tony/AI/String_fighter_AI/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/stable_baselines3/common/utils.py", line 230, in check_for_correct_spaces
    raise ValueError(f"Action spaces do not match: {action_space} != {env.action_space}")
ValueError: Action spaces do not match: MultiBinary(12) != MultiBinary(24)
free(): invalid pointer
Aborted (core dumped)
```
This is because linyi's AI was trained with 1 player mode, so the AI expects 1 player action input. To work around the issue, just simplely comment out the action spaces validation in site-packages/stable_baselines3/common/utils.py (line 230).

## AI vs AI test
Copy `Champion.Level1.RyuVsRyu.2Player.state` files from the `data/` folder file to gym-retro game folder. 

```bash
cd main
python test_ai_vs_ai.py --reset=match
```
## <a name="player2_ai"></a>Train an AI to play as player 2 (right side)
1. Run play_with_ai.py
2. Press "N" to join the game as player2
3. Beat the player 1 (AI)
4. Press "B" to save the state. The state file will be save.state in the current directory
5. Modify the state file name as you like and copy to the retro game directory.
6. You can train the AI as P2:```python train.py --state <state name you saved> --P2AI --render```
7. Test the AI as P2:```python test.py --state <state name you saved> --P2AI ```

## <a name="save-state"></a>Save state

During playing with AI, you can press "B" button to save the state to a file (Champion.Level12.RyuVsBison.2Player.stateï¼‰in the current directory. You can change the file name at line#124 in interactive.py
